# PYPNCI

A Python parody of Netcat's Interface  
Made for a quiz after learning socket communication in Python

## Supported Features
- Basic TCP connection based on socket
- **VERY BASIC** interface just like netcat
- File transmission, while only tiny little ones can be transmitted though

## WIP
*NOPE*
