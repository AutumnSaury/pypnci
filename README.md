# PYPNCI

A Python Parody of Netcat's Interface  
Made for a quiz after learning socket communication in Python

## Supported Features
- Basic TCP connection based on socket
- **VERY BASIC** interface just like netcat
- File transmission, while only tiny little ones can be transmitted though
- Compatible with Netcat

## Known Issues
- Actively exiting without causing a whole bunch of errors on Linux is now impossible
